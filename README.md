This is frontend I created after creating backend routes.

1. created all the components and made them responsive.
2. designed the ui in figma first.
3. used bootstrap and custom css for responsive design.
4. used react-router-dom for creating SPA routes.
5. used contextAPI for state management for user login info and authorizing verification token.
6. and made functions in contexts (for easy access through out all components) with await fetch(`url`,{json body and headers}) for GET,POST,DELETE,PATCH https methods.
7. these https methods helped me connect with the backend for CRUD operations.
